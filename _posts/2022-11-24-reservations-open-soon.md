Reservations open for Drachenwald's 30th Year Celebration and Coronation on 8 Dec at 19:30 CET â€“ a mere two weeks from today!

We're excited to welcome as many people as possible to the event!  We anticipate demand being high for spaces, so would like to explain a few points about how the reservation process will work.

We ask you to please review the info at [https://30year.drachenwald.sca.org/reg/](https://30year.drachenwald.sca.org/reg/) and [https://30year.drachenwald.sca.org/](https://30year.drachenwald.sca.org/accom/) to see the info about pricing, deposits, refund policy, and the types of accommodation we have available.  Please note we have a *lot* of camping space available, so there will be plenty of space for your encampment if you choose to camp!  

Please note that while we have announced a time and date in advance for opening reservations, this is to ensure people don't miss reservations opening and are able to plan accordingly.  Spots are *not* given based on who fills out the reservation form the quickest, so please don't feel you need to rush to fill out the form precisely at 19:30 on the 8th.  

The process will work as follows:

- the form should be filled out for each attendee, no exceptions (so this includes babies/children under 2, who can attend for free with their own baby bed)
- within a few days of filling out the form, the Reservations Steward will contact you confirming the total amount you need to pay for your reservation, and will provide the bank details to which payment can be sent.  Please note this is a manual process, so we appreciate your patience
- to secure your spot, you can either pay the site fee in full at that time, or at least 25% of the total amount, with the rest to be paid no later than 30 April 2023
- when your spot is secure, the Reservations Steward will confirm this to you

Please note that payment of at least 25% is the *only* way to secure your spot- we will not allow spots to be reserved based on travel plans.  In addition, please note paying by PayPal is not a possibility for this event- we strongly recommend using wise.com for international transfers if you are paying from a non-SEPA country.

If you have any questions regarding reservations you can contact the Reservations Steward at [dw30yearres@gmail.com](mailto:dw30yearres@gmail.com), or general questions can be sent to the Event Stewards at [dw30year@gmail.com](mailto:dw30year@gmail.com).  

We look forward to welcoming you to Drachenwald's 30th Year Celebration and Coronation!
