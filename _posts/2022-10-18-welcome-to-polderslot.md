The Shire of Polderslot invites you to join us for a _four day long event_ at a historic castle in Limburg, Netherlands to celebrate 30 years of the SCA in Europe!

The event team are working to make this an unforgettable event, with a wide variety of activities such as armoured
combat, fencing, archery, a market day, a ball, arts and sciences classes, courts, a tavern, and more besides.

The event will take place as Kasteel de Berckt, located in the small town of Baarlo, just a few kilometers
south of Venlo, on the Dutch-German border. With a mix of affordable and luxury accommodations, this will be
one of the biggest SCA gatherings you can find this side of the Atlantic Ocean.

We have a lot more to share in the coming weeks and months, so follow along on Facebook or your RSS reader.
