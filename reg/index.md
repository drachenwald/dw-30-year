### Registration

<div class="d-grid gap-2 col-6 col-md-4 mx-auto my-3">

<a href="https://forms.gle/FL6aE2gKRKqskjZBA" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-user"></i> Book here</a>

</div>

A **25% deposit will be required** to secure your spot for the event.  After that, you may pay in whatever installments you wish, so long as the full balance has been received by **30 April 2023.** Reservations will be confirmed **in order of payment/deposit received**, not in order of filling in the form.

Any cancellations received up to and including 30 April 2023 will be refunded in full, while any cancellations received from 1 May 2023 onwards will not be refunded except in cases of illness or at the discretion of the event stewards. Requests for discretionary refunds will be evaluated after the event.

### Pricing

This event is a little different to our usual, and so our pricing is different too. We've written about the thinking behind this.

<div class="text-center">
<a href="{% post_url 2022-10-20-pricing %}" class="btn btn-secondary mb-3">How our pricing works</a>
</div>

Registration gets you access to the event and includes:

- Bedding & towels (for those staying indoors)
- Substantial brunch and dinner
- Wifi
- Coffee, tea and water

The pricing in the table below is for **members of SCA Inc or an affiliate**.
For non-member pricing, add €5 to the pricing below.
This additional €5 is per person; paying it once covers you for the entire event.
Please note babies/children up to 2 years of age are free if camping or sleeping in their own cot/bed.
