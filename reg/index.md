Any cancellations received before 30 April 2023 will be refunded in full, while any cancellations received from 1 May 2023 onwards will not be refunded except in cases of illness or at the discretion of the event stewards.

### Pricing

This event is a little different to our usual, and so our pricing is different too. We've written about the thinking behind this.

<a href="{% post_url 2022-10-20-pricing %}" class="btn btn-primary">How our pricing works</a>

Registration gets you access to the event and includes:

- Bedding & towels (for those staying indoors)
- Substantial brunch and dinner
- Wifi
- Coffee, tea and water

The pricing in the table below is for **members of SCA Inc or an affiliate**.
For non-member pricing, add €5 to the pricing below.
This additional €5 is per person; paying it once covers you for the entire event.
